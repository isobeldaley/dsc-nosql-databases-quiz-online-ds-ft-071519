    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A SQL database is organised into tables, each of which can be linked to others through the use of primary/foreign keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database is not organised into tables.  An example would be MongoDB, which stores data in documents (which can be related to one another).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing Twitter communication between a company and its customers.  Each interaction may span multiple messages, and would not fit neatly or efficiently into a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB works by storing data as documents.  For example, each tweet would be a document, and multiple tweets in a conversation woukld be stored in documents linked to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance is the ability of a dataset to withstand a problem with one of the servers on which it is held.  Resilient Distributed Datasets are spread across multiple servers.  Each server contains one part of the dataset, but also backup(s) of other part(s).  This means, if one of the servers goes down, it is still possible to access the entire dataset.  For this reason, it is resilient, and has a high fault tolerance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Hadoop supports RDD.  When a query is run on Hadoop, it is effectively run simultaneously on mutiple servers (containing different parts of the dataset).  The results are then combined ('reduced') to give the total result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
